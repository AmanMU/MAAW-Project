<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->
<p>
With the current situation in the country and the world, people's mental and physical health has been degraded. This has been an ongoing problem for a long time as people have started to spend a more sedentary lifestyle than an active one. Nowadays having an active lifestyle has become impossible due to practical reasons like space and living conditions. With this problem, a new market for indoor sports has come up and Sri Lanka has become very interested in it. Indoor sports have countered all the practical problems that came with normal sports and have influenced the public in becoming healthy and active.
</p><p>
With the increase in demand for indoor sports, arose a new set of problems. Not having a proper mechanism for indoor sports enthusiasts to book and use these facilities, the absence of a proper system to register and manage stadiums, problems in price discrepancies of sessions in different stadiums around the country, and customer disappointment due to improper marketing, are a few of these problems. 
</p><p>
With proper analysis of this situation, we have a solution to counter the aforementioned problems. "book2play", an all in one mobile application which was developed to provide a solution for all indoor sports-related problems around the country.
